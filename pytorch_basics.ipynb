Putting tensors (and models) on the GPU\n","\n","You can put tensors (and models, we'll see this later) on a specific device by calling [`to(device)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.to.html) on them. Where `device` is the target device you'd like the tensor (or model) to go to.\n","\n","Why do this?\n","\n","GPUs offer far faster numerical computing than CPUs do and if a GPU isn't available, because of our **device agnostic code** (see above), it'll run on the CPU.\n","\n","> **Note:** Putting a tensor on GPU using `to(device)` (e.g. `some_tensor.to(device)`) returns a copy of that tensor, e.g. the same tensor will be on CPU and GPU.
